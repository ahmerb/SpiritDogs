# SpiritDogs

This is the SpritDogs application repo.
By Ahmer Butt and Louis Wyborn.

See individual directories for some more detailed readme's.

REFERENCE: The amazing serverless book at [serverless-stack.com](https://serverless-stack.com/) got us started. This repo grew (a lot) from there.

- `backend` is the api. Its a javascript serverless app built using the Serverless framework.
- `classifier-sagemaker` is where the SpiritDogs dog breed classifier resides (Keras/TF).
- `client` is the ReactJS frontend.
- `load-test` are Locust (python) load testing scripts.
